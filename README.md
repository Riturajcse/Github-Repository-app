# Github-Repository-app

This is the code of my github-repository-app.
When run it will ask for the url which is of the format http://github.com/user/repo.
http://github.com/ is allready given so all you need is to enter user/repo.

For Example suppose you want to see  https://github.com/Shippable/support/issues all you need to enter is
Shippable/support in the box and it will show you-
-Total number of open Issues
-Issues opend in last 24 hours
-Issues opened in last 24 hour to 7 days
-Issues older than 7 days
